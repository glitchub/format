Format strings in the style of printf, passing them character-by-character to
the designated FORMAT_CHAR function. This is intended for use in embedded
systems compiled with GCC.

The following format sequences are supported:
     %[flags][width]c                             -- argument is char
     %[flags][width][.precision]s                 -- argument is pointer to char (NULL will be treated as "(null)")
     %[flags][width][.precision][size]{i|d}       -- argument is signed int, printed as decimal with a sign
     %[flags][width][.precision][size]{u|b|o|x|X} -- argument is unsigned int, printed as decimal, binary, octal or hex

Flags are zero or more of:
     "-" : output is left-justified within specified width instead of right-justified
     "0" : right-justified numbers have with leading "0"s instead of spaces
     "+" : positive signed integers have a leading "+"
     " " : positive signed integers have a leading space

Width is minimum total number of characters to be output, padded with space or
"0" as required. Specify "0" to "255", or "*" to use the low byte of the next
int argument.

Precision is maximum number of string characters to output (including 0), or
mininum number of numeric digits to output (with leading "0"s as needed).
Specify ".0" to ".255", or ".*" to use the low byte of the next int argument.

Size is one of:
     none : argument is an int
     "l"  : argument is a long
     "ll" : argument is a long long
All other values must be cast to one of these.

If a FORMAT_CHAR macro is defined, then it defines a function to be called for
each formatted character (passes as an unsigned int), and this prototype is
used:

    void format(const char *fmt, ...)

This method is somewhat faster and requires less stack.

If a FORMAT_CHAR macro is not defined, then this prototype is used:

    void format((void(*FORMAT_CHAR)(unsigned int), const char *fmt, ...)

This method allows greater flexibility.

The test.c program simply outputs most possible formats, it can be built to use
format() or printf(). The Makefile builds both flavors and verifies they have
the same output.
